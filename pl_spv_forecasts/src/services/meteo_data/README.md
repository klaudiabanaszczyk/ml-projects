## Introduction
This directory contains code related to fetching meteorological data from two publicly available sources: OpenWeather and VisualCrossing.

The code within this directory allows you to connect to these APIs, retrieve weather data, and process it into a usable format.

For more detailed information about each data source, please refer to the respective subfolders.


## Libraries
To use some functions from `utils.py`, you should install the geopandas library. To install that, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install geopandas==0.9.0
```
