# Forecast production of photovoltaic installations in Poland

## Project Description
This project aims to forecast the amount of energy generated by solar farms in Poland in the short term, specifically for day-ahead and 2-day-ahead periods.

## Features
- **Data Fetching from PSE API**
  - Implement scripts to fetch real-time energy production data from the Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne (PSE) API.
  - Parse and store the retrieved data for further analysis.

- **Meteorological Data Fecthing**
  - Fetch weather forecast data from meteorological APIs.
  - Collect historical weather data to support model training and validation.

- **Preliminary Data Analysis**
  - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify relationships between energy production and meteorological variables.
  - Generate visualizations and statistical summaries to uncover trends and patterns in the data.
  - Conduct feature engineering to create new predictive variables from the raw data.
